						Celeritas was purdue solar's eight car. During the two year design and build cycle, I was elected to as safety director for a semester, and after, as the electrical engineering director for a year. Celeritas was the team's first urban concept car, a racing category for the Shell Eco-Marathon. The urban concept category was created to encourage design of concept cars, that were more like your typical everyday car. Celeritas was also the first Purdue Solar car with a fully computerized electronic system. The custom built electronics in the car utilized a CAN bus for the system level communications and PIC microcontrollers for the onboard processing. Celeritas won first place in both the 2011 and 2012 Shell Eco-Marathon with 2,200 MPG-E  and 2,325 MPG-E respectively. The team also won the Communications offtrack award for both years.
